Its core purpose is to increase platform adoption by ensuring consistent training delivery, comprehensive solution coverage, and operational efficiency.Trainings within the framework are built as GitHub Codespaces\u2014they\u2019re publicly accessible, run seamlessly across environments, and adhere to a defined set of standards to ensure quality, repeatability, and alignment across teams.</p>"},{"location":"#audience-use-cases","title":"Audience &amp; Use Cases","text":"<p>What will we do</p> <p>In this tutorial we will learn how easy it is to create an enablement using codespaces and a Kubernetes cluster!</p> <ul> <li>Yes! let's begin </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cleanup/","title":"Cleanup","text":"<p>Deleting the codespace from inside the container</p> <p>We like to make your life easier, for convenience there is a function loaded in the shell of the Codespace for deleting the codespace, just type <code>deleteCodespace</code>.
