## The Goal of the Framework


!!! tip "The goal of this effort"
    **Reduce complexity, remove friction and increase adoption of the Dynatrace Platform**

    The Dynatrace Enablement Framework is a structured set of tooling and best practices designed to streamline how we deliver, maintain, and scale solutions across the Dynatrace Platform. Its core purpose is to increase platform adoption by ensuring consistent training delivery, comprehensive solution coverage, and operational efficiency.Trainings within the framework are built as GitHub Codespaces—they’re publicly accessible, run seamlessly across environments, and adhere to a defined set of standards to ensure quality, repeatability, and alignment across teams.



## What this tutorial is all about
In this tutorial we'll learn:

- how this codespace is being built
- how is the separation of concerns of the architecture in this devcontainer
- the functions.sh file
- create Github documentation and publish it
- How MKDocs work
- monitor the Github documentation
- monitor the instatiation of codespaces (learn about the usage of a specific enablement)
- exposing ports
- tipp & tricks
- troubleshooting
- and more...




!!! tip "What will we do"
    In this tutorial we will learn how easy it is to create an enablement using codespaces and a Kubernetes cluster!
