    This codespace is powered by the Dynatrace Enablement Framework, this means that this codespace:

      - can run in github codespaces, as a remote container or locally as docker container
      - is crosscompiled for AMD and ARM architectures
      - follows a set of standards and best practices for enhancing the user experience

## Project Goals

!!! tip "The goal of this effort"
    **Reduce complexity, remove friction and increase adoption of the Dynatrace Platform**

    The Dynatrace Enablement Framework is a structured set of tooling and best practices designed to streamline how we deliver, maintain, and scale solutions across the Dynatrace Platform. Its core purpose is to increase platform adoption by ensuring consistent training delivery, comprehensive solution coverage, and operational efficiency.Trainings within the framework are built as GitHub Codespaces—they’re publicly accessible, run seamlessly across environments, and adhere to a defined set of standards to ensure quality, repeatability, and alignment across teams.

  
## Audience & Use Cases


!!! tip "What will we do"
    In this tutorial we will learn how easy it is to create an enablement using codespaces and a Kubernetes cluster!
