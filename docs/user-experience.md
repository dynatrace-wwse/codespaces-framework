To maximize adoption and maintain the Dynatrace public imageâ€”particularly among DevOps stakeholdersâ€”repositories leveraging the enablement framework should adhere to the following best practices.

- Present all materials and interfaces in a professional and consistent manner.
- Ensure the project is governed by a clear and recognized open source license.
- Tag stable releases to provide clear versioning and facilitate reliable adoption.
- Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date changelogs to document project evolution.
- Structure code for readability and scalability, supporting both maintainability and future growth.
- Provide clean, well-organized, and accessible documentation for all users.
- Respond promptly and constructively to issues and community feedback.
- Use inclusive language throughout documentation and communications.
- Display relevant badges, such as build status, license, and coverage, to communicate project health and transparency.
- Incorporate recognizable logos to reinforce project identity.
- Offer interactive, hands-on training resources to accelerate onboarding and skill development.
- Recommend tools such as p10k, k9s, and zsh to further enhance the DevOps experience.

By following these guidelines, the framework remains accessible, professional, and appealing to the broader DevOps and open source communities.


## Tips and Tricks

### ðŸ§ˆ Navigating the Kubernetes Cluster Like Butter

One of the most efficient ways to interact with your Kubernetes cluster is by using `k9s`, a terminal-based UI that streamlines cluster management and troubleshooting.

**Getting Started with k9s:**

- Launch `k9s` by simply running `k9s` in your terminal (it comes pre-installed in the Codespaces Enablement Framework).
- The interface provides a real-time, interactive view of all your Kubernetes resourcesâ€”pods, deployments, services, and more.
- Use the arrow keys to navigate, `/` to filter resources, and `:` to enter commands (e.g., `:ctx` to switch contexts, `:ns` to change namespaces, `:pod`to list pods, `:svc` to list services, `:dynakube` to list dynakubes)
- Press `d` to describe a resource, `l` to view logs, and `s` to open a shell into a pod.
- Press `0` Zero to list all resources, namespaces, services
- All actions are keyboard-driven, making it fast and intuitive for power users and beginners alike.

**Why use k9s?**

- Rapidly diagnose issues, monitor workloads, and manage resources without leaving your terminal.
- Visualize pod health, events, and logs in real time.
- Reduce context switching and streamline your DevOps workflow.


For more details, see the [k9s documentation](https://k9scli.io/) or try it out in your Codespace now.
